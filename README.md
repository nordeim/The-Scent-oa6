## ‚ú® Project Overview

**The Scent** is an immersive e-commerce platform dedicated to premium aromatherapy products, designed to transport visitors into a sensory journey from the moment they land on the site. This repository showcases a thoughtfully crafted landing page that combines elegant aesthetics with subtle interactive elements to create a digital experience as calming and enriching as the products themselves.

## üé® Design Philosophy & Inspiration

### Multisensory Digital Experience

Our design challenge was ambitious yet essential:

> **How can we make a website _feel_ aromatic?**  
> **How do we evoke calm, luxury, and artisanal quality through pixels alone?**

To solve this, I drew inspiration from:

- **Nature's Movement**: The gentle drift of scent through air, visualized through subtle SVG "scent trail" animations
- **Premium Wellness Brands**: Aesop and Lush's immersive storytelling approach to product presentation
- **Sensory Harmony**: Balancing visual elegance with optional audio elements for a richer experience
- **Global Ingredient Stories**: Showcasing the worldwide origins of premium botanical ingredients

### Design Principles

1. **Immersion First**: Full-screen hero with video background and animated scent trails creates immediate atmosphere
2. **Sensory Richness**: Optional ambient nature sounds enhance the calming experience
3. **Elegant Transitions**: Subtle animations and parallax effects create a sense of depth and dimension
4. **Dual Moods**: Thoughtfully designed light/dark mode transitions represent daytime vitality or evening relaxation
5. **Personalization**: Interactive quiz to help visitors discover their ideal scent profile

## üñ•Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Key Features

- **Animated SVG Scent Trails**: Custom-generated paths with subtle opacity and movement animations
- **Responsive Parallax Sections**: Product origin story enhanced with depth through subtle parallax effects
- **Interactive Scent Quiz**: Multi-step personalization flow with smooth transitions between questions
- **Scroll-Triggered Elements**: Testimonials and product cards that animate into view as the user explores
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Complete theme transformation with a single click
- **Ambient Audio Option**: User-controlled nature soundscape to enhance the sensory experience
- **Floating CTA**: Persistent but unobtrusive "Shop Now" button with subtle pulse animation

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5/CSS3**: For semantic structure and advanced visual styling
- **CSS Custom Properties**: For theme switching and consistent design language
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For interactions, animations, and quiz functionality
- **GSAP/ScrollTrigger**: For advanced scroll-based animations
- **SVG Animation**: For the custom scent trail effects
- **Font Awesome**: For cohesive iconography throughout the experience

## üß† Design Methodology & Process

### User-Centered Approach

1. **Audience Analysis**: Designed for wellness-oriented consumers seeking calm in their digital experiences
2. **Journey Mapping**: Created a narrative flow from initial impression to personalized product discovery
3. **Sensory Testing**: Refined animations and transitions to avoid overwhelming users
4. **Accessibility Focus**: Ensured the site supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and respects user motion preferences

### Process Highlights

- **Mood Boarding**: Gathered visual and conceptual references from premium wellness brands and nature
- **SVG Exploration**: Experimented with various animation techniques to visualize "scent" in a digital space
- **Color Psychology**: Developed a palette that conveys natural luxury and calm in both light and dark modes
